    <h1>HTML Elements:</h1>
    <p>   An HTML element is a piece of content on a web page that is defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag. The start tag begins an HTML element and the end tag closes it. Elements can contain other elements, attributes, and text.</p>
    <p> &lt;p&gt; this is paragraph element &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <h1>HTML Attributes:</h1>
    
    <p>An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about an element, such as its behavior, appearance, or name. Attributes are included in the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value.</p>
<p>&lt;a href = "link"&gt;  &lt;/a&gt; </p>


<h1>HTML TAGS</h1>
<P>. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and usually come in pairs consisting of a start tag and an end tag. The start tag indicates the beginning of an HTML element, and the end tag indicates the end of that element.

    For example, the &lt; p &gt; tag is used to define a paragraph of text, and consists of a start tag &lt; p &gt;  and an end tag &lt;/p &gt; . The content between the start and end tags is the text that appears on the web page as a paragraph.
    
    HTML tags can also include attributes, which provide additional information about the element. Attributes are included within the start tag and consist of a name and a value. For example, the <a> tag is used to create links, and includes an href attribute to specify the URL that the link points to.</P>
