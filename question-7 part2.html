    Nesting operators in Emmet allow developers to create nested HTML and CSS code quickly and easily. <br>

There are two main nesting operators in Emmet: <br>
<ol> <li>> (Child Selector): This operator selects only the direct child elements of the parent element. For example, the code ul > li selects all the li elements that are directly inside the ul element. <br></li>

<li>+ (Adjacent Sibling Selector): This operator selects the next sibling element that comes immediately after the previous element. For example, the code h1 + p selects the p element that comes directly after the h1 element. <br></li>


By combining these nesting operators, developers can create complex nested HTML and CSS code with just a few keystrokes. For example, the code ul > li.item + li.item + li.item selects three li elements that are direct children of a ul element and have the class name "item". The + operator is used to select adjacent li elements with the same class name. <br>
</ol>
Overall, nesting operators in Emmet provide a powerful and efficient way to create nested HTML and CSS code, saving developers time and effort in the front-end web development process.
