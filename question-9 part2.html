    Self-closing tags are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag because they don't contain any content or child elements. They are written with a trailing slash (/) before the closing angle bracket (>), for example: <br>


&lt;img src="image.png" alt="An image" /&gt; <br>
&lt;br /&gt; <br>
&lt;input type="text" name="username" /&gt; <br>
These tags can be used to insert images, line breaks, and form elements, among other things. Self-closing tags are a shorthand way to write HTML code that is more concise and easier to read. <br>

Meta tags are a type of HTML tag that provide metadata about a web page. They are placed in the head section of an HTML document and are not visible to the user. The most common meta tags are: <br>

meta charset: Specifies the character encoding used in the document.<br>
meta name="viewport": Specifies the viewport settings for the document, such as the initial zoom level and the width of the viewport.<br>
meta name="description": Provides a brief description of the content of the page for search engines and social media platforms.<br>
meta name="keywords": Specifies a list of keywords that describe the content of the page.<br>
meta name="author": Specifies the name of the author of the page.<br>
Meta tags are important for search engine optimization (SEO) and can help improve the visibility of a web page in search results. They can also improve the user experience by providing information about the content of the page before it is loaded.
